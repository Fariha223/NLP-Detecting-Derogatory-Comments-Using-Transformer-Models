# **NLP for Detecting Derogatory Comments Using Transformer Models**

## **Overview**

This research focuses on detecting derogatory comments in both Bengali and English using Transformer models. The study demonstrates significant improvements over previous F1 scores in Bengali datasets through a comprehensive approach involving data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training.

## **Methodology**

- **Data Collection and Preparation**:
  - Combined Bengali and English datasets were utilized.
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed to ensure high-quality input.

- **Data Splitting**:
  - The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance accurately.

- **Model Training**:
  - Transformer models were trained on the prepared dataset.
  - Various techniques were employed to enhance model accuracy and performance.

## **Results**

The combined dataset and rigorous approach led to a notable improvement in the F1 score, surpassing previous benchmarks in the Bengali dataset.
